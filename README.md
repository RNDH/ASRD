## ðŸ“š Selected Resources

Five Arabic semantic resources were used as the foundation for constructing the dataset:

- **Arabic WordNet (AWN)**  
  A specialized version of the Princeton WordNet (PWN) for Arabic. AWN includes Arabic-specific senses in addition to synsets aligned with PWN. It distinguishes between two types of hypernym relations: *subclass-of* for concepts and *instance-of* for objects.  
  ðŸ”— [AWN Website](http://globalwordnet.org/resources/arabic-wordnet/)

- **Open Multilingual WordNet**  
  A multilingual WordNet that links concepts and synsets to PWN. Only concepts that can be aligned with PWN are retained; others are discarded.  
  ðŸ”— [OMW](https://omwn.org/omw1.html)

- **The Arabic Ontology**  
  An ontology using *subsumption* as a backbone relation, along with other semantic links like *InstanceOf*, *PartOf*, *SameAs*, and *SubClassOf*. It contains instantiable concepts rooted in expert, scientific, and commonsense knowledge.

- **RADIF Thesaurus (for Antonymy and Synonymy)**  
  A resource containing synonyms, antonyms, rhymes (qawafi), and plurals extracted from the Radif mobile application.  
  ðŸ”— [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mdanok/ArabicLT)  
  ðŸ”— [Radif App on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tahadz.radif_dictionary)
